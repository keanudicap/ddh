List of ideas for pathfinding.  This list is also used to decide
publication strategy.

* JPS + improvements (JAIR)
+ pre-processing
+ multiple terrain (large uniform-cost areas)
+ different types de grids (hexa, 4-connected, octile, ?)
+ (longer term) informed multiple jump point (certain jump points are
  flagged as ``jumpable'', which means that we believe it will be
  beneficial to do a multiple jump on them; typically points that
  lead to dead-ends or to places with a single exit)

* Any-angle: anya, interval-based algorithm.  

* Weighted grids (?)

* Complexity analysis 
+ Determine how hard path planning will be on a given map
+ On-line estimate of planning complexity for a given problem (this
  can trigger a switch to a non-optimal algorithm)

* JPS + CPD
+ Only store the CPD for jump points (requires to compute 8 paths)
+ Only store the parts of the CPD where the decision differs from the
  previous node
