Selected papers from the Conference "Computer Science and Operations Research: New Developments in Their Interfaces" held on 8 - 10 January 1992 in Williamsburg, Virginia

Not sure but this could be very similar to glover96. Seems to cover the same ground.

There is also a paper with the same title as glover96 but dated to 1992. This is an extended (137 page) version of the 96 paper. It includes extra things like a proof that there exists a first order delete\add simple path connecting any tour to any other.},

This is combined with a Tabu Search that makes use of both short term and long term memory (through strategic oscillation) and a post-optimisation phase that tries to improve each individual tour further after a solution to the VRP is found. 
Parallel and sequential implementations are discussed; the former is slightly more efficient.},

The search algorithm uses a simple low level tabu search for bookkeeping (to avoid repeating states) and some higher level tabu search to intensify or diversify the search. The latter simply changes the tabu tenure of deleted edges combined with frequency analysis of deleted and added edges in the solution.

Interestingly, this approach produces solutions within ~1-2.5% of the best known but works much faster than the best heuristic algorithms of the day.},

CDRs are further generalised for undirected VRPs, giving the GDR reference structure.

Distance bounds are computed wrt minimum and maximum distances from each node to blocks in a quadtree decomposition. Distances are gradually refined and many candidates can be eliminated early. As an added bonus the alogorithm can terminate before fully refining every path! Quite neat and works much nicer than kNN over just the set of low-level nodes in the spatial network.}

Additional "shallow" pruning also identifies symmetric children of the current state using a similar approach. A canonical form for describing states is used to speed up symmetric state identification (without this identification is hard: each state has many automorphisms, each needs to be compared to every node on open + closed). Paper nicely explained but poorly structured paper. Results are OK but other types of symmetries not considered (e.g. partial orders). }
