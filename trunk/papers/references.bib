	Abstract = {This paper explores new approaches to the symmetric traveling-salesman problem in which 1-trees, which are a slight variant of spanning trees, play an essential role. A 1-tree is a tree together with an additional vertex connected to the tree by two edges. We observe that (i) a tour is precisely a 1-tree in which each vertex has degree 2, (ii) a minimum 1-tree is easy to compute, and (iii) the transformation on "intercity distances" cij  Cij + i + j leaves the traveling-salesman problem invariant but changes the minimum 1-tree. Using these observations, we define an infinite family of lower bounds w() on C*, the cost of an optimum tour. We show that maxw() = C* precisely when a certain well-known linear program has an optimal solution in integers. We give a column-generation method and an ascent method for computing maxw(), and construct a branch-and-bound method in which the lower bounds w() control the search for an optimum tour.},
	Annote = {Describes the 1-Tree lowerbound for TSPs
Discusses minimising the "gap" between the lowerbound and optimal tour.
Proposes a formulation that weights the nodes of the TSP and then uses a variety of column generation, IP and B&B techniques to minimise the gap by penalising nodes with degree > 2 and rewaring nodes with degree < 2},

The search algorithm uses a simple low level tabu search for bookkeeping (to avoid repeating states) and some higher level tabu search to intensify or diversify the search. The latter simply changes the tabu tenure of deleted edges combined with frequency analysis of deleted and added edges in the solution.

Interestingly, this approach produces solutions within ~1-2.5% of the best known but works much faster than the best heuristic algorithms of the day.},
