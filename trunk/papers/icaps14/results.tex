\section{Comparison with JPS 2011}
\label{sec::results}


We first analyse the impact on JPS search performance for various combinations of our 
optimisation techniques: JPS (B), which adds block-based 
jumping, JPS (B + P) which combines block-based jumping with improved pruning, JPS+
which adds pre-processing and JPS+ (P) which combines pre-processing with improved pruning.
To avoid confusion we will denote the original algorithm as JPS 2011.

	   \caption{\small We measure the relative performance (or improvement factor) of each of our new JPS variants 
against the original. We consider two metrics: nodes expanded and search time. An improvement factor of 2 
for search time means twice as fast; for node expansions it means half as many nodes expanded. 
Higher values are always better.}
\label{fig::vs_jps2011}
\end{figure*}

We have previously observed that the bottleneck of the JPS 2011 algorithm is individual node
expansion operations. In Table~\ref{table::expansion} we give results for the average
time required to expand one million random starting nodes from each input map in
each benchmark set. We find that block-based jumping and pre-processing jump points
each improve average times by one and two orders of magnitude respectively vs. JPS 2011.
Pruning intermediate jump points from the search tree increases the average branching 
factor by several times but the time-per-expansion is still much better. 

In Figure~\ref{fig::vs_jps2011} we give a summary of search performance, in terms
of time and node expansions, for all GPPC instances on each of our three benchmark sets. 
In each case and for each metric we consider relative improvement vs. JPS 2011.
We show the spread of results after having assigned all test instances into buckets of 
similar length.
We observe that any of our alternative approaches is strictly faster than the original. 
Moreover, JPS (B) and JPS (B + P) have all the same advantages as JPS 2011: they are 
fast, optimal, online and require, in principle at least, no extra memory vs. JPS 2011
(recall that in practice we store a rotated copy of map to improve memory access
patterns).
A summary of pre-processing requirements is given in Table~\ref{table::preproc}. Note
that JPS+ and JPS+ (P) have the same requirements and are not listed separately.


\section{Comparison with SUB}
SUB~\cite{urasKH13} is a recent pathfinding technique from the literature.
As one of the joint winners of the 2012 Grid-based Path Planning Competition (GPPC) 
SUB has been shown to be very fast and is considered the current state of the art.
We compare against two variants described by the original authors: SUB-S (S
for Simple) and SUB-TL (TL for Two Level). The former is guaranteed optimal
while the latter is not.  To evaluate SUB-S and SUB-TL we used the authors'
original C++ implementation which we obtained from~{\small
\url{http://gppc-2012.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/entries/SUB-a/}}.

Table~\ref{table::preproc} compares the pre-processing requirements of 
SUB-S and SUB-TL with JPS+ (JPS+ (P) has identical requirements and is not shown). 
We observe that both JPS+ and SUB are able to pre-process most maps in well under a second 
and in most cases using less than 10MB of memory. A small number of notable exceptions 
arise for both JPS+ and SUB-TL.
In Figure~\ref{fig::vs_sub} we compare our four JPS variants with SUB-S and SUB-TL across all
game map instances from the 2012 GPPC. We find that JPS (B) and JPS (B + P) are both
competitive with, and often faster than, SUB-S. Meanwhile, JPS+ (P) appears competitive 
with SUB-TL for a large set of instances.
Across our three benchmarks, DA:O, DA2 and SC, we measured an improvement for 
JPS (B + P) vs. SUB-S in 92\%, 84\% and 89\% of tested instances respectively.
For JPS+ (P) vs. SUB-TL we measured an improvement in 43\%, 77\% and 68\% of 
tested instances respectively.

		   and offline) with two recent and very performant algorithms: simple subgoal graphs (SUB-S) 
		   and two-level subgoal graphs with local edge pruning (SUB-TL). All JPS variants and SUB-S 
		   are provably optimal. SUB-TL is not.}

\section{Discussion}
The results demonstrate the superiority of the approaches presented in this
paper. In JPS (B) and JPS (B + P) we have improved the performance of
JPS 2011 by several factors all while retaining
the same advantages inherent to the original algorithm: completeness, 
optimality and little-to-no memory overhead. Such results are remarkable as
JPS 2011 has itself been shown to improve the performance of classical
search algorithms such as A* by up to one order of magnitude and sometimes more.

We have shown with JPS+ and JPS+ (P) that further improvements are also possible. 
In our experiments we employ an offline pre-processing step together with a small 
amount of memory (10MB or less in most cases) and identify apriori all jump 
point successors of each grid node.
The main advantage is performance: JPS+ and JPS+ (P) can improve the search times of 
JPS 2011 by up to one order of magnitude.
The main disadvantage is that if the map changes the pre-processed
database needs to be re-computed. We have shown that each such pre-computation
can be performed very fast -- usually requiring only tens or hundreds of 
milliseconds. Moreover the pre-computation can be easily parallelised over
several time slices with JPS (B + P) employed as a fallback algorithm in
the interim.

We have compared our JPS-based approaches against two variants of SUB~\cite{urasKH13}.
The first variant, SUB-S guarantees optimality; the second, SUB-TL, does not. 
We find that across most benchmark instances JPS (B) and 
JPS (B + P) are not only competitive with but faster than SUB-S. When we compare
JPS+ (P) and SUB-TL we find the two algorithms often have complementary strengths:
JPS+ (P) always has low pre-processing requirements, always finds the optimal path
and is faster on a majority class of tested instances; SUB-TL has low space
requirements and quickly finds optimal or near-optimal solutions to a large class 
of remaining instances.
