\section{Conclusion}
We study any-angle pathfinding: a problem commonly found in the areas of
robotics and computer games. It involves finding a shortest path between two
points in a grid but asks that the path is not artificially constrained to the
points of the grid.  We give a new algorithm for this problem: Anya.  Our
approach works by representing sets of points from the grid as intervals and
considers all points from an interval together at the same time. From each
interval we select a representative point which has a minimum $f$-value. We show
that this approach is both complete and optimal. Moreover, it requires no
preprocessing and relies on no special data structures during search.  Any-angle
pathfinding has received signficiant attention from the AI and Game Development
communities but until now it has been an open question whether any optimal
online algorithm exists. Anya answers this question in the affirmative.
