Any-angle pathfinding is a common problem from robotics
and computer games: it requires finding a Euclidean shortest path between 
pairs of vertices in a grid map.
Prior research has focused on approximate online solutions for the problem.
A number of exact methods exist but they all require supra-linear space and
preprocessing time. 
Our contribution to this area is a new online algorithm we call Anya:
it solves the any-angle problem optimally by searching over sets of states 
represented as intervals.
Each interval has a representative point used to derive an $f$-value during
search. Also associated with each interval is a corner point which allows
us to project intervals from one row of the grid to another.
Anya compares favourably with existing research: it is online and 
optimal, it does not rely on any precomputation and it does not introduce 
any additional memory overheads.
