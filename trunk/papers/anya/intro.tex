Essentially, the reason why the existing algorithms are not optimal
is that the search is based on the grid intersections.  
However, because the final any-angle path 
may never cross these intersections, 
the $A^*$ $f$ value associated with the intersections
is not relevant.  
In this article, we propose to run the search not on the grid 
but instead on the edges of the graph.
