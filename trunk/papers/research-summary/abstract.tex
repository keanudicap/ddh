My research proposes new techniques for speeding up grid-based pathfinding by
identifying and explicitly dealing with symmetries in the search space.  
Together with my co-authors I have developed two different algorithms
to accomplish this: Rectangular Symmetry Reduction (RSR) and Jump Point
Search (JPS).
RSR is an offline graph pruning
technique which facilitates fast exploration of empty areas by decomposing a
grid map into a set of empty rectangles.  JPS
can be described as an online graph pruning method which speeds up pathfinding
by selectively expanding only certain nodes on a grid map called \emph{jump
points}.  Both RSR and JPS are entirely orthogonal to existing speedup
techniques.  Results to date have shown that both RSR and JPS yield
state-of-the-art performance, in many cases improving average search times for
a search algorithm such as A* by an order of magnitude and more.
