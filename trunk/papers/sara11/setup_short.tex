\section{Experimental Setup}
We evaluate RSR on three benchmarks from the University of Alberta's freely
available pathfinding library Hierarchical Open Graph
(HOG): {\textbf{Adaptive Depth}
is a set of 12 synthetic maps of size 100$\times$100.
{\textbf{Baldur's
Gate} is a set of 120 maps from BioWare's popular roleplaying game
\emph{Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn}.  They range in size from $50\times50$
to $320\times320$ and often appear as a standard
benchmark in the literature \cite{bjornsson06,harabor10,pochter10}.}
{\textbf{Rooms} is a set of 300 maps of size
256$\times$256, each divided into small rectangular areas
($7\times7$). Rooms has
previously appeared in \cite{sturtevant09,pochter10,goldenberg10}.}
\par
We used two copies each map: one in which diagonal transitions are allowed and 
another in which they are not.  
For each map we generated 100 valid problem instances, checking that every
instance could be solved both with and without the use of diagonal transitions.
Our test machine had a 2.93GHz Intel Core 2 Duo processor, 4GB RAM and ran OSX
10.6.2.  Our implementation of A* is based on one provided in HOG, which we
adapted to facilitate our online node pruning enhancement.
