\begin{algorithm}
\caption{Graph reduction based on empty rectangles}
\label{alg:rsr}
\begin{algorithmic}
\REQUIRE A grid map 
\begin{enumerate}
\item{\label{alg:rsr:1} Decompose the grid map into a series of disjoint
obstacle-free rectangles; e.g. as in \cite{harabor10}. The size and placement of 
rectangles can vary, depending on the positions of obstacles.}
\item{\label{alg:rsr:2} Prune all tiles from the interior of each rectangle $R$
and possibly some from the perimeter (border).}
%, and any tiles from the
%perimeter which have no neighbours in any adjacent room.} 
\item{\label{alg:rsr:3} Add to each rectangle $R$ a series of \emph{macro edges} between 
selected pairs of tiles from the perimeter. The cost of each edge is equal to
the Octile (or Manhattan, on 4-connected grids) distance between endpoints.}
\item{\label{alg:rsr:4} During search, temporarily re-insert tiles back into the map to handle cases where the
start or goal is a location which has been previously pruned.}
\end{enumerate}
