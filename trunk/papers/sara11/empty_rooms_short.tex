\section{Rectangular Symmetry Reduction}
\label{sec:rsr}
In the AI literature a path in a graph is usually written as: $\langle v_0,\ldots,v_n\rangle$. 
Here $v_0$ is the initial (or start) node, $v_n$ is the target (or goal) node and 
each pair of adjacent nodes represents an edge in the graph.
In the context of grid maps, it is sometimes helpful to equivalently describe a path as an ordered sequence
of actions $\langle \vec{d_0}, \ldots, \vec{d_n}\rangle$ where each action $\vec{d_i}$ is a vector representing 
a direction of travel. 
When executed by an agent, the effect of each action is to move the agent from the node it currently
occupies on the grid (initially $v_0$) to one of the eight immediately neighbouring nodes. The last action 
results in the agent occupying the target node $v_n$.
Using this formulation, a path is valid if no action results
in the agent moving to a location which is an obstacle.

\begin{definition}
\label{def:symmetry}
Two valid paths $\pi_{1}$ and $\pi_{2}$ are symmetric if they share the same start and
goal node and one can be derived from the other by swapping the order of the actions.
\end{definition}

To identify and eliminate path symmetries from the grid we will employ the high 
level strategy in Algorithm \ref{alg:rsr}.

RSR is similar to 4ERR~\cite{harabor10}, a symmetry breaking algorithm 
limited to 4-connected grid maps.
The main differences are: (i) we generalise 4ERR to 8-connected grid maps 
(ii) we give a stronger offline pruning operator to eliminate more nodes from
the grid (iii) we give a new online pruning operator that further speeds up search.
