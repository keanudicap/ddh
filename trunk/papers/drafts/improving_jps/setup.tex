\section{Experimental Setup}
\label{sec::setup}
We implemented Jump Point Search and a number of variants as described
in this this paper. All source code is written from scratch in C++.
%and is available from {\small \url{http://ddh.googlecode.com}}.
For all our algorithms we have applied a number of simple optimisations 
that help to effectively stride through memory and reduce the effect of 
cache misses.
This means that (i) we store the input map as a vector of bits, one bit 
for each node; (ii) we store the map twice, once in row major order and 
once in column major order; (iii) we pre-allocate memory in 256KB chunks.

We run experiments on a 2010 iMac running OSX 10.6.4. Our machine has 
a 2.93GHz Intel Core 2 Duo processor with 6MB of L2 cache and 4GB of RAM.
For test data we selected three benchmark problem sets taken from
real video games: Dragon Age: Origins, Dragon Age 2 and StarCraft.  
All maps and test instances are availble from

All have appeared in the 2012 Grid-based Path Planning Competition.
