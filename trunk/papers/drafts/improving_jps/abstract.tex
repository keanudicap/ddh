\begin{abstract}
We give several online and offline optimisation techniques for improving 
the performance of Jump Point Search (JPS).
We make three contributions: (i) we enhance the pruning rules of JPS, allowing
it to ignore many nodes that must otherwise be expanded;
(ii) we give a new and more efficient procedure for online symmetry breaking
by manipulating ``blocks'' of nodes at a single time rather than individual
nodes; (iii) we give new offline pre-processing technique that can identify
jump points apriori in order to further speed up pathfinding search.
On three benchmark domains taken from real computer games we show that our 
enhancements can improve JPS performance by anywhere from several factors 
to over one order of magnitude. We also compare our approaches with SUB: a very
recent state-of-the art pathfinding algorithm. We show that our improvements
are competitive with this approach and often faster.
