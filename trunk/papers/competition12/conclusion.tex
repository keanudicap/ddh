\section{Discussion}
For the 2012 GPPC we configured 
JPS+ to reformulate the entire map during an offline phase.
The precomputation runs in time linear to the size of the input graph
and produces a symmetry-reduced graph which is much faster
to search. 
An alternative approach is to replace, during search, each forced or 
natural neighbour with a newly identified jump point successor.
JPS+ requires very little memory: the reformulated graph
is stored as an adjacency list that replaces the original input graph.
When the input graph is also stored as an adjacency list, JPS+
has zero memory overhead.
