\begin{abstract}
We explore a symmetry-based reformulation technique which can speed up optimal
pathfinding on undirected uniform-cost grid maps by over 30 times.  Our offline
approach decomposes grid maps into a set of empty rectangles, removing from each
all interior nodes and possibly some from along the perimeter. We then add
macro-edges between selected pairs of remaining perimeter nodes to facilitate
provably optimal traversal through each rectangle.  To further speed up search,
we also develop a novel online pruning technique.  Our algorithm is fast, memory
efficient and retains both optimality and completeness during search.
