\begin{abstract}
In this paper we explore a symmetry-based search space reduction technique
 which can speed up optimal pathfinding on undirected uniform-cost grid maps by
 up to 38
times.  Our technique decomposes grid maps into a set of empty rectangles,
removing from each rectangle all interior nodes and possibly some from along the
perimeter. We then add a series of macro-edges between selected pairs of
remaining perimeter nodes to facilitate provably optimal traversal through each
rectangle.  We also develop a novel online pruning technique to further speed up
search.  Our algorithm is fast, memory efficient and retains the same optimality
and completeness guarantees as searching on an unmodified grid map.
