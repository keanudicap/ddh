\section{Rectangular Symmetry Reduction}
\label{sec:rsr}
A path in a uniform-cost grid 
$< s, \vec{d_1}, \ldots, \vec{d_i}, t >$ 
is a series of ordered actions that are executed by an agent located at 
at a starting node $s$ and which must navigate to a target node $t$.
Each action $\vec{d_i}$ is a vector representing a direction of travel for
the agent. The effect of each action is to move the agent from the node it currently
occupies on the grid to one the eight immediately neighbouring nodes.
We will say that a path is valid if none of its constituent actions results
in the agent moving to a location which is an obstacle.

\begin{definition}
\label{def:symmetry}
Two valid paths $\pi_{1}$ and $\pi_{2}$ are symmetric if they share the same start and
target node and one can be derived from the other by interchanging the order of
two or more actions.
\end{definition}

To identify and eliminate path symmetries from the grid we will employ the high 
level strategy in Algorithm \ref{alg:rsr}.

Our approach has similarities with 4ERR~\cite{harabor10}, a symmetry breaking algorithm 
limited to 4-connected grid maps.
The main differences are: (i) we generalise 4ERR to 8-connected grid maps 
(ii) we give a stronger offline pruning operator to eliminate more nodes from
the grid (iii) we give a new online pruning operator that reduces a node's branching
factor and further speeds up search.
