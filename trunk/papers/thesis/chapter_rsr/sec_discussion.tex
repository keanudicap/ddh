\section{Discussion}
\label{cha::rsr::discussion}

We introduce RSR, a new search space reduction algorithm applicable to
pathfinding on uniform cost grid maps. RSR is fast, memory efficient,
optimality preserving and can, in some cases, eliminate entirely the need
to search.  
When running on a grid pruned by RSR, A* is up to 38 times faster than
otherwise.
\par
We compare RSR with a range of search space reduction algorithms from the
literature. Compared to 4ERR~\cite{harabor10}, on which it is based, RSR is
shown significantly faster on the set of instances where both methods can be
applied (i.e. 4-connected maps).  Next, we compare RSR to Swamps-based
pruning~\cite{pochter10} and show that the two algorithms have complementary
strengths.  We find that Swamps are more useful on maps with small open areas
while RSR becomes more effective as larger open areas are available on a map. We
also identify a broad range of instances where RSR dominates convincingly and is
clearly the better choice.  Finally, we compare RSR to the enhanced Portal
Heuristic~\cite{goldenberg10}.  We show that our method exhibits similar or
improved performance but requires up to 7 times less memory.  As with Swamps, we
find that the two ideas are complementary and could be easily combined.
