\section{Practical Challenges and Tradeoffs}
Put here an example showing why symmetry is a problem.

\section{Contributions and Target Applications}
In this thesis we will aim to compute shortest paths in a static environment
represented as a two-dimensional grid of traversable and non-traversable cells.
This common formulation appears often in contexts such as robotics and especially 
computer games. Despite their apparent simplicity problems of this type can often 
be surprisingly challenging to solve. This is because practitioners 
(game developers in this case) must often satisfy two very different and competing 
requirements. On the one hand characters in games should appear intelligent and 
when they move they should find short realistic-looking paths. On the other hand, 
paths should be computed quickly and with as few resources as possible. 
This situation has led game developers to con

In modern computer games 

for example it is not unusual to dedicate only 1-10\% of 
CPU resources for all AI-related activities -- including pathfinding~\cite{tozour08}.
Likewise, there are often very restrictive limitations placed on the amount
of available memory. This situation has led researchers and game developers
to consider
