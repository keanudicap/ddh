\item Chapter~\ref{cha::lit} surveys pathfinding results from 
academic and industry literature and provides a background for remaining chapters.
\item Chapter~\ref{cha::rsr} presents the Rectangular Symmetry Reduction algorithm.
The contributions from this chapter have been previously reported in~\cite{harabor10,harabor11a}.
\item Chapter~\ref{cha::jps} presents the Jump Point Search algorithm. 
The contributions from this chapter have been previously reported in~\cite{harabor11b,harabor12}.
\item Chapter~\ref{cha::jps2} presents various enhancements to the Jump Point Search algorithm.
\item Chapter~\ref{cha::anya} presents the new results for solving the any-angle pathfinding problem
optimally and online.
The contributions from this chapter have been previously reported in~\cite{haraborG13}.
\item Chapter~\ref{cha::conclusion} presents the conclusion of the thesis and a summary of future work.
