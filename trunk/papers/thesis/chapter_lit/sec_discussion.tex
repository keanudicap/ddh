\section{Discussion}

Algorithms of this type usually aim to identify areas on the map that do not need to be explored in
order to reach the goal optimally. Though not as fast as abstraction or memory
heuristics, such methods usually have low memory requirements and can improve
pathfinding performance by several factors. Typical examples: Dead-end Heuristic~\cite{bjornsson06}
Swamps~\cite{pochter09} and the Portal Heuristic~\cite{goldenberg10}.
