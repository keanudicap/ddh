\section{Abstraction Techniques}
\label{cha::lit::abstraction}
In cases where optimality is not required, hierarchical pathfinding methods
are pervasive.  They improve performance by decomposing the
search space, usually offline, into a much smaller approximation.  Algorithms
of this type, such as HPA*~\cite{botea04}, are  fast and
memory-efficient but also suboptimal.

Algorithms of this type are fast and use little memory but compute paths which are usually not
optimal and must be refined via further search. Typical examples: HPA*~\cite{botea04} and
MM-Abstraction~\cite{sturtevant07}.
