\section{Notation and Terminology}
\label{sec:notation}
We work with undirected uniform-cost grid maps.  Each node has $\leq 8$
neighbours and is either traversable or not.  Each straight (i.e. horizontal or
vertical) move, from a traversable node to one of its neighbours, has a cost of
1; diagonal moves cost $\approx\sqrt 2$.  Moves involving non-traversable
(obstacle) nodes are disallowed.  The notation $\vec{d}$ refers to one of the
eight allowable movement directions (up, down, left, right etc.).  We write $y =
x + k\vec{d}$ when node~$y$ can be reached by taking $k$ unit moves from
node~$x$ in direction $\vec{d}$.  When $\vec{d}$ is a diagonal move, we denote
the two straight moves at 45-degrees to $\vec{d}$ as $\vec{d_1}$ and $\vec{d_2}$.

A path $\pi =~\begin{pth}n_{0}, n_{1}, \ldots , n_{k}\end{pth}$ is a cycle-free
ordered walk starting at node $n_{0}$ and ending at $n_{k}$.  We will sometimes
use the setminus operator in the context of a path: for example $\pi \setminus
x$. This means that the subtracted node $x$ does not appear on (i.e. is not
mentioned by) the path.  We will also use the function $len$ to refer the length
(or cost) of a path and the function $dist$ to refer to the distance between two
nodes on the grid: e.g. $len(\pi)$ or $dist(n_{0}, n_{k})$ respectively.
