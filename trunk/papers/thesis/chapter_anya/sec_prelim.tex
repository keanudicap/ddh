\section{Preliminaries}
A \emph{grid} is a planar subdivision consisting of $W \times H$ square cells.
%It is common in such settings to simply mark each cell as traversable or
%non-traversable and treat each one as a unique location during pathfinding search.
%This simple model has an unfortunate sideeffect: any computed path is forced
%to pass through the centre point of any cell it intersects.
%However we would like to compute optimal paths that can intersect traversable cells 
%at any point and which may not pass through the centre of any cell.
Each cell is an open set of \emph{interior} points which are 
all \emph{traversable} or all \emph{non-traversable}.
%\footnote{Such cells are sometimes called obstacles.}.
The vertices associated with each cell are called the
\emph{discrete} points of the grid. Each such point $p$ has a unique coordinate $(x, y)$
where $x \in \{0,\dots,W\}$ and $y \in \{0,\dots,H\}$.
% refers to an explicit vertex 
Edges in the grid can be interpreted as open intervals of \emph{intermediate}
two points; each one representing a transition between two discrete points. 
\par
A discrete or intermediate point is traversable if it is adjacent to 
at least one traversable cell. Otherwise it is non-traversable.
%We now define some terminology for discussing discrete points:
A discrete point which is common to exactly four adjacent cells is called an \emph{intersection}.
Any intersection where three of the adjacent cells are traversable and one is not
is called a \emph{corner}.
We will say that two points are \emph{visible} from one another if there exists a 
straight-line path connecting them which does not pass through any non-traversable point.
%A \emph{corner} is an intersection 
%such that only one of its four squares is non-traversable.  
%Intersection $i'$ is \emph{visible} from intersection $i$ 
%iff the segment $(i,i')$ crosses only traversable tiles 
%or borders non-traversable tiles and traversable tiles.  
%Without loss of generality, 
%we assume that if the segment $(i,i')$ crosses a corner 
%(besides $i$ and $i'$), 
%then intersection $i'$ is not visible from intersection $i$.  

An \emph{any-angle path} $\pi$ is a sequence of points 
$\langle p_1,\dots,p_k \rangle$ where each $p_{i}$ is visible from $p_{i-1}$
and $p_{i+1}$.
The \emph{cost} of $\pi$ 
is the cumulative distance between every successive
pair of points $d(p_1,p_2) + \dots + d(p_{k-1},p_k)$, 
where $d((x,y), (x',y'))= \sqrt{(x-x')^2 + (y-y')^2}$ 
is a uniform Euclidean distance metric.
We will say $p_i \in \pi$ is a \emph{turning point} if the segments
$(p_{i-1}, p_i)$ and $(p_i, p_{i+1})$ form an angle.
\\
\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma::anya::corner}
%  Given two discrete points $p$ and $p'$, 
  Any turning point in the optimal any-angle path between points $p_1$ and 
$p_k$ is also a corner point.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
{
  Assume an optimal any-angle path $\pi = \langle p_1,\dots,p_k \rangle$ 
  that includes a turning point $p_l$ ($l \not\in \{1,k\}$) 
  which is not a corner.  
  We will prove that $\pi$ is suboptimal 
  which, by contradiction, will prove the lemma.  
  If $p_{l+1}$ is visible from $p_{l-1}$, 
  then  $\pi \setminus p_l$ is a path 
  which is strictly shorter than $\pi$.  
  Hence $\pi$ is suboptimal.  
  If $p_{l+1}$ is not visible from $p_{l-1}$, 
  then let $p'_{l}$ be a point from the segment $\langle p_l,p_{l+1} \rangle$ 
  that (i) is visible from $p_{l-1}$ 
  and (ii) is different from $p_l$; 
  because $p_l$ is not a corner, 
  such a $p'_l$ exists.  
  Moreover, the subpath $\langle p_{l-1}, p'_{l}, p_{l+1} \rangle$ is 
  strictly shorter than $\langle p_{l-1}, p_{l}, p_{l+1}\rangle$. 
  Hence $\pi$ is suboptimal.
  This case is illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig::anya::corner}  
  where the point $p'_l$ is chosen as close as possible from the corner $c$.  
}
\end{proof}
Lemma~\ref{lemma::anya::corner} is interesting because it allows us to define 
any-angle paths as a sequence of straight lines which intersect only at
discrete corner points.
