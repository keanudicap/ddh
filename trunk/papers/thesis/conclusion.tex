My work in this area can be broadly classified as a search space pruning
technique. Where it differs from existing efforts is that, instead of trying to
identify areas that do not have to be crossed during search, I aim to identify
and prune symmetric nodes that prevent the fast exploration of an area. This
idea nicely complements existing search-space reduction techniques and, as it
turns out, also complements most grid-based abstraction methods and memory
heuristic approaches.
