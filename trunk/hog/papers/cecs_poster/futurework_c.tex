We are currently investigating techniques which will allow us to prune tiles from the perimeter 
of empty rooms.
If successful, this would allow us to avoid exploring empty rooms from which the goal cannot be 
reached and thus further speed up search.
Another direction for further work involves the development of an analogous symmetry elimination 
algorithm for 8-connected grid maps.
8-connected grids also exhibit a high degree of path symmetry but the problem is more difficult
because each tile on the perimeter of a empty room has a potentially higher branching factor.
