\section{Annotated A*}
\label{aha:aastar}
Low-level planning for our extended problem using clearance values is a straightforward application of the ideas thus far.
To compute an optimal shortest path between a start and goal node we use a variation on the classical A* algorithm \cite{astar}, which we term Annotated A* (AA* for short). 
Our approach differs from standard A* by requiring two additional parameters for each query: the agent's size and capability. 
Recall that clearance can be computed on demand for each visited location. 
Therefore, each atomic octile under consideration by the algorithm can be dynamically evaluated as either blocked or traversable.
This allows us to map any query into a canonical problem as shown earlier.
