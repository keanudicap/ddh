\section{Conclusion}
We introduce Rectangular Symmetry Reduction (RSR), a new symmetry-breaking algorithm
applicable to pathfinding on undirected uniform-cost grid maps. RSR is fast,
memory efficient, optimality preserving and can, in some cases, eliminate
entirely the need to search.  After symmetry elimination A* can
search some grids over 30 times faster than before.
\par
Compared to the 4ERR~\cite{harabor10} pruning algorithm, on which it is based,
RSR's performance dominates convincingly.
We also show that RSR is complementary to and often faster than Swamps-based
pruning~\cite{pochter10}.
We find that Swamps are more useful on maps with small open areas
while RSR becomes more effective as larger open areas are available on a map. 
When compared to the enhanced Portal Heuristic~\cite{goldenberg10}, we find that 
RSR has similar or improved performance but requires up to 7 times less memory.
As with Swamps, we find this method is easily combined with RSR.
\par
Future work includes reducing the branching factor in RSR further through the 
development of better map decompositions and stronger online node pruning
strategies.
Another interesting topic is combining RSR with Swamps or the Portal Heuristic.
