My research proposes a new technique for speeding up grid-based pathfinding in
performance-sensitive or resource-limited application areas such as robotics and
video games.  I work specifically on the problem of identifying and eliminating
symmetric path segments from the search space.  To achieve this, I decompose an
arbitrary grid map into a set of empty rectangles and remove from each
rectangle all interior nodes and possibly some from along the perimeter.  A
series of macro edges are then added between selected pairs of remaining nodes
in order to facilitate provably optimal traversal through each rectangle.  The
new algorithm, Rectangle-based Symmetry Reduction (RSR), can speed up A* search
by up to 38 times on a range of uniform cost maps taken from the literature.
When compared to the state of the art, RSR shows signficant improvement; often
dominating convincingly across a range of benchmarks.
