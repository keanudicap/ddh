\section{Discussion}
For the 2012 Grid-based Path Planning Competition we perform the entire 
reformulation step of JPS+ during an offline precompuation phase. 
An alternative approach would be to perform the reformulation online by
replacing, during search, each forced or natural neighbour with a newly
identified jump point successor located in the same relative direction.
The precomputation runs in time linear to the size of the input graph
and produces a reformulated symmetry-reduced graph which is much faster
to search. JPS+ requires very little memory: the reformulated search space
is stored as an adjacency list that replaces the original input graph.
In cases where the input graph is also stored as an adjacency list, JPS+
can retain a zero memory overhead.
