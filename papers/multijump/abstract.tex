\begin{abstract}
  We extend the Jump Point Search technique 
  used for path planning in homogeneous grid 
  in two ways.  
  First, we propose to pre-process the jump-points 
  which has a very small (linear) memory overhead.  
  Second, we propose a multi-step 
  which allows to identify non trivial cul-de-sacs.  
  Experiments show that both extensions provide 
  substantial runtime improvements.
