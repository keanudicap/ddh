  We extend the Jump Point Search technique 
  used for path planning in uniform-cost grid 
  in two ways.  
  First, we propose to pre-process the jump points, 
  which avoids the on-line identification of the jump points 
  at the cost a very small (linear) memory overhead.  
  Second, we propose a multi-step version 
  which allows to skip many jump points in labyrinthine environments.  
  Experiments show that both extensions provide 
  substantial runtime improvements.
