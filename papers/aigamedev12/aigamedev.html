		In this article I attempt to explain
		path symmetry: a property of uniform-cost grid maps and other regular
		search domains which can significantly slow down pathfinding.  I describe
		how symmetry manifests itself and briefly discuss some approaches that
		other people have tried to improve things.  Finally, I introduce two
		recent ideas from my doctoral research: Rectangular Symmetry Reduction
		(RSR) and Jump Point Search (JPS).  Both are optimality-preserving
		techniques that explicitly identify and eliminate symmetry in order
		to speed up pathfinding by an order of magnitude and more. I discuss their
		strengths, weaknesses and observed performance on two popular video-game

		<h2>1. Path Symmetries</h2>

		Often appearing as a pathfinding domain in areas such as robotics
		and video games, grid maps are a simple yet popular method for
		representing an environment.
		As it turns out, grids are also academically interesting for the
		following reason: between any given pair of locations, there usually exists many
		possible paths.
		Sometimes these
		paths represent alternative ways of reaching one location from the other but
		more often they are <b>symmetric</b> in the sense that the only difference
		between them is the order in which moves appear.

		<div class="image" style="width: 245px; float:right; ">
			<div class="cell">
				<img style="width:225px" src="images/symmetry.png" alt="" title="Symmetry Example" />
			</div>
			<div class="caption" style=""> 
				<b>Figure 1: Symmetry.</b> A simple grid-based pathfinding problem. 
				For simplicity (but not in general) we allow only straight moves
				and not diagonal.
				Many optimal length paths could be returned as 
				the solution; we highlight only a few. Notice that each one 
				is a permutation of all the others. In such cases we say that a
				symmetry exists between the paths.
			</div>
		</div>

		<p/>

		Before proceeding further it is necessary to establish some precise
		terminology. For example: what exactly is a path?
		Traditionally, Computer Scientists define paths as ordered sequences
		of connected edges. The conjunction of these edges represents a walk in 
		the search graph from some arbitrary 
		start location to some arbitrary goal location.
		However this definition is too general to capture the
		idea of symmetry in grid maps. For that, we need a slightly different
		notion of a path: 

		<div class="algorithm" style="overflow:auto">
			<b>Definition 1: Grid Path.</b> A path in a grid map is an <i>ordered sequence of
				vectors</i>, where each vector represents a single step from one node 
			on the grid to an adjacent neighbouring node.
		</div>


		The distinction between edges and vectors is an important one as it allows us to
		distinguish between paths that are merely equivalent (i.e. of the same
		length) and those which are
		symmetric. But what, exactly, does it mean to have a symmetric
		relationship between paths? 

		<div class="algorithm" style="overflow:auto">
			<b>Definition 2: Path Symmetry.</b> Two grid paths are <i>symmetric</i> if
			they share the same start and end point and one can be derived from
			the other by swapping the order of the constituent vectors.
		</div>

		As a clarifying example, consider the problem instance in Figure 1. 
		Each highlighted path is symmetric to the others since they all have the
		same length and they all involve some permutation of 9 steps up and 9
		steps right. 


		<p/>
		In the presence of symmetry a search algorithm such as A* is forced to
		explore virtually every location along each optimal path.  In Figure 1,
		depending on how we break ties, A* might expand every node on the entire
		map before reaching the goal.
		Further, A*
		will usually consider many other nodes that appear promising but that are
		not on any optimal path.  For example, each time A* expands a node from
		the fringe of the search, it has already likely found almost every
		symmetric shortest path leading to that node
	   	(again, depending on how we break ties when two nodes appear equally good). But
		this effort is in vain if these expansions do not lead the search closer
		to the goal and instead into a dead-end.
		Thus arises
		the question which I will attempt to answer in this article: how do we
		deal with symmetry when pathfinding on grid maps?

		<h2>1.1 Existing Methods For Speeding Up Search</h2>

		<p/>
		A large number of techniques have been proposed to speed 
		up pathfinding. 
		Most can be classified as variations on three themes: 
		<ol>
			<li>
			Reducing the size of the search space through abstraction.
			<p/>
			Algorithms of this type are fast and use little memory but compute paths
			which are usually not optimal and must be refined via further
			search. 
			Typical examples: HPA* <a href="#2">[2]</a>, MM-Abstraction <a href="#9">[9]</a>.
			</li>
			<li>
			Improving the accurary of heuristic functions that guide search.
			<p/>
			Algorithms of this type usually pre-compute and store distances
			between key pairs of locations in the environment. Though fast and
			optimal, such methods can incur signficant memory overheads which
			is often undesirable. Typical examples: Landmarks <a href="#6">[6]</a>, True Distance
			Heuristics <a href="#10">[10]</a>.
			</li>
			<li>
			Dead-end detection and other state-space pruning methods.
			<p/>
			Algorithms of this type usually aim to identify areas on the map
			that do not need to be explored in order to reach the goal
			optimally.
			Though not as fast as abstraction or memory heuristics, such methods 
			usually have low memory requirements and can improve
			pathfinding performance by several factors.
			Typical examples: Dead-end Heuristic <a href=#1">[1]</a>, Swamps <a href="#8">[8]</a>, Portal
			Heuristic <a href="#7">[7]</a>.

			</li>
		</ol>

		My work in this area can be broadly classified as a search space
		pruning technique. Where it differs from existing efforts is that,
		instead of trying to identify areas that do not have to be crossed during
		search, I aim to identify and prune symmetric nodes that prevent the
		fast exploration of an area.  This idea nicely complements
		existing search-space reduction techniques and, as it turns out, also
		complements most
		grid-based abstraction methods and memory heuristic approaches.

		<h2>1.2 Rectangular Symmetry Reduction and Jump Point Search</h2>

		My co-authors and I have developed two distinct approaches for
		explicltly identifying and eliminating path symmetries on grid maps.
		I outline them here very briefly and in more detail in an upcoming post:
		<ol>
			<li>
			Rectangular Symmetry Reduction (RSR).
			<p/>
			RSR <a href="#4">[4]</a><a href="#5">[5]</a> can be described as a pre-processing algorithm which identifies
			symmetries by decomposing the grid map into empty rectangular regions.
			The central idea, then, is to avoid symmetries by only ever expanding 
			nodes from the perimeter of each rectangle and never from the interior.
			</li>
			<li>
			Jump Point Search (JPS).
			<p/>
			JPS <a href="#3">[3]</a> consists of two simple neighbour pruning rules that
			are applied recursively during search. Each rule considers the
			direction of travel to a given node from its parent (either a straight
			step or a diagonal step) in order to prune the set of local
			neighbours (tiles) around that node.
			The central idea is to avoid
			any neighbours that could be reached optimally from the parent of
			any given node. In this way we are able to identify and avoid,
			on-the-fly, large sets of symmetric path segments; such as those in Figure 1.
			</li>
		</ol>

		RSR can pre-process most maps in under a second and has a very small
		memory overhead: we need to keep only the id of the parent rectangle each
		node is associated with (and the origin and dimensions of each such
		rectangle). By comparison, JPS has no pre-processing requirements and no
		memory overheads.  Both algorithms are optimal and both can speed up A* by an order of
		magnitude and more.  Figure 2 shows a typical example; For reference, I
		also include a screenshot for vanilla A*.

			<div class="caption"> 
				<b>Figure 2: Search Effort.</b>
				All nodes marked red must be expanded before the optimal path 
				to the goal (marked in blue) is found.
				Notice that, in the case of A*, many nodes on the fringe of the search
				(i.e. on the edge of the red area) can only be reached by
				paths that cross large regions of empty space.
				These paths usually have many symmetric alternatives and
				considering them all can require a substantial number of
				node expansion operations. RSR and JPS can detect and 
				eliminate such symmetries and both reach the goal much sooner.

		Coming up: 
		<ul>
			<li>Next, I give a <a href="#section2">technical overview of RSR</a>. 
			<li>After that, I outline the <a href="#section3">mechanical details of JPS</a>.</li>
		</ul>

		<h1><a name="section2">2. Rectangular Symmetry Reduction</a></h1>
		Rectangular Symmetry Reduction (RSR) <a href="#4">[4]</a><a href="#5">[5]</a>
		is a new pre-processing algorithm that
		speeds up optimal pathfinding by decomposing an arbitrary uniform-cost grid
		map into a set of empty rectangles.
		The idea is to avoid symmetries during search by only
		ever expanding nodes from the perimeter of each empty rectangle, and never
		from the interior. 
		To ensure optimal travel through each rectangle we will also add a
		series of macro edges that allow units to "jump" from one side of a
		rectangle's perimeter to the directly opposite side. 
		<p/>

		(This remainder of this section, and the next, give a mechanical
		overview of the algorithm and its properties. If you're impatient, or
		don't care about such things, you can skip ahead and check out some 
		<a href="#section2.2">screenshots</a>.)
		<p/>
		RSR can be described in 3 simple steps. Steps 1 and 2 are
		applied offline; their objective is to identify and prune symmetry from
		the original grid map. 
		The third step is an online node insertion procedure; its objective is
		to preserve optimality when searching for paths in the symmetry-reduced
		grid map.

		<h2>2.1 Properties and Performance</h2>
		RSR has several attractive properties:
		<ol>
			<li>
				It preserves optimality.
			</li>
			<li>
			It has a small memory overhead in practice.
			</li>
			<li>
			Node insertion (Step 3) can be performed in constant time.
			</li>
			<li>
				It can speed up A* search by anywhere from several factors to an
				order of magnitude.
			</li>
		</ol>

		I will focus on points 2 and 4 in the remainder of this section. A
		thorough discussion of points 1 and 3 (including proofs) can be found in
		<a href="#4">[4]</a>.
		<p/>

		<b>Memory Requirements:</b>
		<br/>
		In the most straightforward implement of RSR we need to store the id of
		the parent rectangle for each of the <i>n</i> traversable nodes in the original grid.
		We also need to store the origin and dimensions of each rectangle
		(macro edges can be identified on-the-fly and
			do not need to be stored explicitly).
			This means that, in the worst case, we might need to store up to <i>5n</i> 
			integers.
		In practice however we can usually do much better. 
		For example: there is little benefit in storing or assigning nodes to
		rectangles with few or no interior nodes (1x1, 2x1, 2x2, 3x2, 3x3 etc.).
		We can also avoid the parent id overhead altogether and only store the set of identified 
		rectangles. The only downside is that, during insertion (Step 3
		above), we now need to search for the
		parent rectangle of the start and goal -- instead of being able to identify
		it in constant time.
		<p>
		<b>Performance:</b>
		<br/>
		We evaluated RSR on a number of benchmark grid map sets taken
		from <a href="http://web.cs.du.edu/~sturtevant/">Nathan Sturtevant's</a> freely available pathfinding library, <a
			href="http://code.google.com/p/hog2/">Hierarchical Open Graph</a>.
		One of the map sets is from the game Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn. 
		The other two map sets (Rooms and Adaptive Depth) are both synthetic,
		though the latter could be described as semi-realistic.
		I will give only a summary of our findings; full results and
		discussion is available in the following papers: <a href="#4">[4]</a>
		<a href="#5">[5]</a>.
		<p/>
		In short: we observed that in most cases RSR can consistently speed up A* search by a
		factor of between 2-3 times (Baldur's Gate), 2-5 times (Adaptive Depth)
		and 5-9 times (Rooms). In some cases the gain can be much higher: up to 30 times.
		<p/>
		We found that the extent of the speed gains will be dependent on the topography of 
		the underlying grid map. On maps that feature large open areas or which
		can be naturally decomposed into rectangular regions, RSR is highly
		effective. When these conditions do not exist, the observed speed gains are
		more modest.
		This performance is competitive with, and often better than, Swamps <a
			href="#4">[4]</a>;
		another state-of-the-art search space reduction technique. We did not
		identify a clear winner (each algorithm has different strengths) but did
		notice that the two methods are orthogonal and could be easily combined.

		<h2><a name="section2.2">2.2 Screenshots</a></h2>
		Below are screenshots of A* + RSR in action. In each case tiles marked red 
		must be explored in order to find the optimal solution (marked in blue).
		For comparison, I also show the number of tiles explored by vanilla A*
		when solving the same problem instances. You can click on each image for a larger
		version.

		</div>

		In the next section I will discuss Jump Point Search <a
			href="#3">[3]</a>: a 
		similar-yet-different symmetry breaking technique which builds on some of
		the ideas introduced here. Like RSR, Jump Point Search is highly effective and simple 
		to apply; unlike RSR it can be applied online and has no memory overhead and
		no pre-processing requirements. In most cases, JPS is also faster. 

		<h2><a name="section3">3. Jump Point Search<a/></h2>

		Jump Point Search (JPS) <a href="#3">[3]</a> is an online symmetry breaking algorithm
		which speeds up pathfinding on uniform-cost grid maps by "jumping over"
		many locations that would otherwise need to be explicitly considered.
		Unlike other similar algorithms JPS requires no preprocessing and has no
		memory overheads. Further, it is easily combined with most existing
		speedup techniques -- including abstraction and memory heuristics.
		It can speed up A* search by over an order magnitude and more.

		<p>
		The remainder of this section, and the next, describe the mechanical details and
		algorithmic properties of Jump Point Search. If you don't care for such
		things, feel free to jump ahead and check out some <a
			href="#section3.3">screenshots</a>.
		<p/>
		JPS can be described in terms of two simple pruning rules which are
		applied recursively during search: one rule is specific to
		straight steps, the other for diagonal steps.
		The key intuition in both cases is to prune the set of immediate
		neighbours around a node by trying to prove that an optimal path
	   	(symmetric or otherwise) exists from the parent of the current node to
		each neighbour and that path does not involve visiting the current
		node.
		Figures 1 outlines the basic idea.
		
		<div class="image" style="width:auto;">
			<div class="cell" style="text-align:justify;">
				<img src="images/jps_natural.png", alt="", 
				title="Natural Neighbours" style="float:right"/>

				<div class="caption" style="overflow:auto; margin-right:20px">
				<b>Figure 1: Neighbour Pruning</b>
				<p/>
				Node <b>x</b> is currently being expanded. The arrow indicates
				the direction of travel from its parent, either straight or
				diagonal. 
				In both cases we can immediately prune all grey neighbours as 
				these can be reached optimally from the parent of
				<b>x</b> without ever going through node <b>x</b>.
				</div>
			</div>
		</div>	

		We will refer to the set of nodes that remain after pruning as
		the <i>natural neighbours</i> of the current node. These are marked
		white in Figure 1. Ideally, we only ever
		want to consider the set of natural neighbours during expansion.
		However, in some cases, the presence of obstacles may mean that we need
		to also consider a small set of up to <i>k</i> additional nodes (0
		&#8804 <i>k</i> &#8804 2). We say that these
		nodes are  <i>forced neighbours</i> of the current node.
		Figure 2 gives an overview of this idea.

		<div class="image" style="width:auto;">
			<div class="cell" style="text-align:justify;">
				<img src="images/jps_forced.png", alt="", 
				title="Forced Neighbours" style="float:right"/>

				<div class="caption" style="overflow:auto; margin-right:20px">
				<b>Figure 2: Forced Neighbours</b>
				<p/>
				Node <b>x</b> is currently being expanded. The arrow indicates
				the direction of travel from its parent, either straight or
				diagonal.
				Notice that when <b>x</b> is adjacent to an obstacle
				the highlighted neighbours cannot be pruned; any alternative
				optimal path, from the parent of <b>x</b> to each of these
				nodes, is blocked.
				</div>
			</div>
		</div>	

		We apply these pruning rules during search as follows: instead of 
		generating each natural and forced neighbour we instead recursively 
		prune the set of neighbours around each such node. 
		Intuitively, the objective is to eliminate symmetries by recursively "jumping over" all
		nodes which can be reached optimally by a path that does not visit the
		current node. 
		We stop the recursion when we hit an obstacle or when we find a so-called <i>jump point</i>
		successor. Jump points are interesting because they have neighbours that cannot be reached 
		by an alternative symmetric path: the optimal path must go through the current node.
		<p>
		The details of the recursive pruning algorithm are reasonably
		straightforward: to ensure optimality we need only assign an ordering to 
		how we process natural neighbours (straight steps before diagonal).
		I will not attempt to outline it further here; the full details are in
		the paper and my aim is only to provide a flavour for the work.
		Figures 3 gives two examples of the pruning algorithm in action. 
		In the first case we identify a jump point by recursing straight; in the second case
		we identify a jump point by recursing diagonally.

		<h2>3.1 Properties and Performance</h2>
		Jump Point Search is nice for a number of reasons: 
		<ol>
			<li>
			It is optimal.
			</li>
			<li>
			It involves no pre-processing.
			</li>
			<li>
			It requires no extra-memory overheads.
			</li>
			<li>
			It can consistently speed up A* search by over 10 times; making it
			not only competitive with, but often better than, approximate 
			techniques such as HPA* <a href="#2">[2]</a>.
			</li>
		</ol>

		Properties 1-3 are interesting theoretical results, and rather
		surprising, but I will not address them further here. My
		main objective in this article is simply provide a flavour for the work;

		Property 4 is perhaps of broadest practical interest so I will give a
		short summary of our findings below.

		We evaluated JPS on four map sets taken 
		from <a href="http://web.cs.du.edu/~sturtevant/">Nathan Sturtevant's</a> freely available pathfinding library, <a
			href="http://code.google.com/p/hog2/">Hierarchical Open Graph</a>.
		Two of the benchmarks are realistic, originating from popular <a
			href="http://www.bioware.com">BioWare</a> video games <i>Baldur's
			Gate II: Shadows of Amn</i> and <i>Dragon Age: Origins</i>.
		The other two <i>Adaptive Depth</i> and <i>Rooms</i> are synthetic
		though the former could be described as semi-realistic. In each case we
		measured the relative speedup of A* + JPS vs. A* alone.
		<p/>
		
		Briefly: JPS can speed up A* by a factor of between 3-15 times (Adaptive
		Depth), 2-30 times (Baldur's Gate), 3-26 times (Dragon Age) and 3-16
		times (Rooms). In each case the lower figure represents average
		performance for short pathfinding problems and the higher figure for
		long pathfinding problems
		(i.e. the longer the optimal path to be found, the more benefit is
		derived from applying JPS). 		
		<p/>
		What makes these results even more compelling is that in 3 of the 4
		benchmarks A* + JPS
		was able to consistently outperform the well known
		HPA* algorithm <a href="#2">[2]</a>. This is remarkable as A* + JPS is always performing
		optimal search while HPA* is only performing approximate search.
		On the remaining benchmark, Dragon Age, we found there was 
		very little to
		differentiate the performance of the two algorithms.

		<p/>
		<b>Caveat emptor:</b> It is important to highlight at this stage that A* +
		JPS only achieves these kids of speedups because each benchmark problem
		set contains a large number of symmetric path segments (usually manifested
		in the form of large open areas on the map). In such cases JPS can exploit
		the symmetry and ignore large parts of the search space. In the process
		A* both generates and expands a much smaller number of nodes and reaches
		the goal much sooner.
		When there is very little symmetry to
		exploit however we expect that our gains will be more modest.

		<h2><a name="section3.2">3.2 Screenshots</a></h2>
		Below in Figure 4 are screenshots of A* + JPS in action. In each case
		tiles marked red must be explored in order to find the optimal solution
		(marked in blue).  For comparison, I also show the number of tiles
		explored by A* + RSR and vanilla A* when solving the same problem
		instances. You can click on each image for a larger version.

		<h2>4. Final Thoughts</h2>
		The explicit identification and elimination of symmetries in pathfinding
		domains is an idea that until now has received little attention in the
		academic literature.
		Approaches for dealing with symmetry, such as Jump Point Search, provide us
		with powerful new tools for reducing the size of explicit regular search
		spaces. By eliminating symmetry we speed up not just A* but entire classes
		of similar pathfinding algorithms.
		Also, consider: JPS is entirely orthogonal to almost every other
		speedup technique applicable to grid maps. Thus, there is no reason why we
		couldn't combine it, or other similar methods, with hierarchical
		pathfinding approaches, memory heuristics or even other
		optimality-preserving state-space reduction	techniques.
		That means the results presented thus far are only the tip of the
		iceberg in terms of performant grid-based pathfinding methods.
		<p>
		Another exciting aspect of this work is the possiblities it opens for
		further research. For example: could we pre-process the map and go even
		faster? Or: are there analogous jumping rules that one could develop for weighted grids? 
		What about other domains? Could we apply the lessons learned thus far to
		help solve other interesting search problems?
		The answers to the first two questions already appear to be positive;
		the third is something I want to explore in the near future. Regardless
		of how it all turns out, one thing is certain: it's an exciting time to
		be working on pathfinding!
