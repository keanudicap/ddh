\input table_benchmarks

We evaluate TRANSIT on a subset (Table \ref{table:benchmarks})
of Sturtevant's popular and freely
available~\footnote{http://movingai.com/benchmarks}
grid map benchmarks~\cite{sturtevant2012benchmarks}.
These problem sets have appeared extensively in the literature;
for example in~\cite{botea04,bjornsson06,sturtevant07,felner09,pochter09,goldenberg10,harabor11b}.
Some, such as BG and DAO, are taken from real video games. The others,
comprising Rooms-32 and Mazes-1, are synthetic.
We selected from each benchmark set maps we considered to be challenging;
either due to the presence of extensive uniform-cost path symmetries
(as discussed in the preceding section)
or due to topographic features which are likely to induce significant
error for standard heuristics such as Manhattan Distance and Octile Distance (e.g. narrow corridors,
dead-ends etc).


For each map we generate 10K valid problems from across all possible problem lengths.
Our implementation is written entirely in Java. We perform all experiments
on an Intel Core2Duo with 8GB RAM.
For comparative purposes we include results for a similar set of instances
using Compressed Path Databases (CPD). This algorithm is originally described in~\cite{botea11};
its source code was kindly made available to us by the original author.
