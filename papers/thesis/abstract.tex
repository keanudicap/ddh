Pathfinding (or navigating) from A to B is difficult when many variations of the same path exist. 
We speed things up by developing new techniques that elimnate a large number of these symmetries.
\par
Our first contribution, Rectangular Symmetry Reduction, breaks symmetries during an offline
preprocessing step. It is optimal, requires very little overhead and is often better than recent
search space reduction methods from the literature.
Our second contribution, Jump Point Search, improves on the performance of RSR by several factors
and represents the current state of the art for grid-map domains.
In its online form JPS requires zero preprocessing, zero additional memory and always finds the 
shortest path.
In its offline form JPS reformulates the search space to achieve better performance but requires
an up-front investment of time and may introduce a linear-size memory overhead.
\par
In addition to RSR and JPS we study the related any-angle pathfinding problem. Regarded as an 
open problem within the pathfinding community, we give new results 
showing that it can be solved optimally and online. Our new algorithm, ANYA, compares favourably
with existing approaches which all require trading away at least one of: 
speed, space efficiency or optimality.
