\section{Non-Octile Domains}
We have described Jump Point Search in the context of octile (i.e. 8-connected) grid maps.
However, the approach can be easily extended to any kind of regular search domain.
In this section we generalise JPS to two commonly appearing domains:
\begin{itemize}
\item{4-connected Grid Maps}
\item{Hexagonal Grid Maps}
\end{itemize}

These domains both appear commonly in computer games (citations?) and have been
studied in the academic literature~\citep{yap02}.
