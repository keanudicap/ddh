\section{Weighted Grid Maps}
Jump Point Search breaks uniform-cost path symmetries. These can appear
in weighted grid maps where the environment is divided up into uniform
cost regions.
We will describe a simple generalisation of JPS to such domains.
\begin{enumerate}
\item{Spell out weighted-cost model.}
\item{Need to maintain local optimality.}
\item{Maybe mention the really-simple approach of stop-when-neighbour-has-different-terrain?}
\end{enumerate}
