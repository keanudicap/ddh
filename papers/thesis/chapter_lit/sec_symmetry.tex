\section{Symmetry Breaking}
\label{cha::lit::symmetry}
Approaches for identifying and eliminating search-space symmetry have been
proposed in areas including planning \cite{fox99}, constraint programming
\cite{gent00}, and combinatorial optimization \cite{fukunaga08}. 
Very few works however explicitly identify and deal with symmetry in pathfinding
domains such as grid maps.
