\section{Discrete Search Graphs}
\label{cha::lit::graphs}
Many approaches exist for creating a search graph from a given input map; we
discuss a broad range of popular methods in the remainder of this section.
\\ \newline
Should mention~\citep{yap02} and (see Cindy's thesis for other ref) which 
compare different types of representations. Also Tozour's Search Space Representations
article.
Maybe a section on choosing which one?

\subsection{Grid Maps}
\label{cha::lit::graphs::grid}
A grid map is a tesselation of unit squares, often called tiles, which is
applied over a planar input map. Each tile has up to eight adjacent neighbours
and is marked as traversable or non-traversable depending on whether or not it
intersects any obstacles.  Agents are often modeled as unit-size entities that
occupy a single tile and move from the centre of one traversable tile to the
next.  
An alternative approach is to model agents as point-size entities that occupy 
the intersections of the grid and which travel in straight steps along the
explicit edges of grid and diagonally through tile interiors.
In both cases straight steps incur a cost of 1. Diagonal steps, if permitted, 
incur a cost of $\sqrt{2}$.  When diagonal moves are not permitted the grid map 
is said to be \emph{4-connected}; otherwise it is \emph{8-connected}.  

Grid maps are popular for several reasons: (i) they are simple to understand 
and simple to apply (ii) they can be represented as a matrix of bits and stored
efficiently (iii) individual nodes can be updated or queried in constant time.
One significant disadvantage of grid maps is their fixed resolution. In many cases 
grids are too coarse to accurately model the underlying input map. Increasing the
number of tiles is not always possible: there is always a corresponding increase in
memory requirements and searching in a larger grid often makes pathfinding more 
challenging.
Another disadvantage of grid maps is that they produce paths which are
constrained to the points of the grid. Such paths are not only aesthetically
displeasing but they can also be longer than stricictly necessary and may
require post-processing to ``smooth'' them.

\subsection{Roadmaps}
\label{cha::lit::graphs::road}
A roadmap is a set of connected points that are drawn from a given input map.
Conceptually similar to \emph{road networks}, which model automotive
transportation systems, roadmaps are used to solve high dimensional pathfinding
problems in the area of robotics.  Many variants exist. The Probabilistic
Roadmap (PRM)~\citep{kavraki94}, for example,
 is created by randomly sampling a configuration space (i.e. the input map) in
order to build a connected graph. Another approach, known as the Reachability
Roadmap (RRM)~\citep{geraerts05} applies a grid tesselation in the first
instance and then chooses points from the grid.  Voronoi Diagrams~\citep{aurenhammer91}
can also be regarded as a type of roadmap. In this case a network of edges is constructed
which are all equi-distant from any surrounding obstacles; the nodes of the network are 
found at the intersections of these edges.

Roadmaps are advantageous because they are an effective means of discretising
large multi-dimensional search spaces into small graphs that can be searched
efficiently. For example: using a roadmap any pathfinding problem can be
factored into three smaller subproblems: find a path from each of the start and
target configuration to a point on the roadmap then search for a path on the
roadmap that connects these two points. Disadvantages include:
\begin{itemize}
\item{Some types of roadmaps are not complete. For example, when using a PRM the probability of 
a path being found, if one exists, increases with the number  of samped points~\citep{barraquand97}. 
Other types of roadmaps, such as RRMs, have stronger guarantees but their applicability
is limited to pathfinding in two and three dimensions.}
\item{Roadmaps are applicable only in static environments. The introduction of
new obstacles or changes to the placement of existing obstacles typically require 
the roadmap to be re-computed. A one-shot variation of the roadmap idea has been
developed to address this limitation~\citep{lavalle98} but it is not as reliable
as static roadmaps.}
\item{Roadmaps compute only approximately shortest paths and they assume a single 
robot type (i.e. they are normally not reusable).}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Navigation Meshes}
\label{cha::lit::graphs::nav}
A navigation mesh can be described as a low-fidelity wire-frame model of an input
map. Commonly used in computer games~\citep{snook00,tozour02}, navigation meshes are a
popular technique for representing walkable and non-walkable surfaces in two but
more often three-dimensional space.  One approach for creating a navigation mesh
involves directly triangulating the input map~\citep{demyen07,kallmann10}.  
Another procedure~\cite{mononen09} uses voxel decomposition in order to construct a 
mesh of convex polygons that can be used for pathfinding.

Navigation meshes are popular because they are complete and they are often more
memory efficient than other search graphs e.g. grid maps. Another advantage is
flexibility; e.g., meshes can often be hand-edited by level designers needing
fine grained control over agent navigation. Meshes are also well understood by 
game developers and industry standard tools exist to aid their creation; 
e.g. \textsc{NavPower} and \textsc{Recast Navigation}. Disadvantages include: 
\begin{itemize}
\item Meshes need to be recomputed/repaired if the environment changes.
\item Computed paths may need to be post-processed.
\item Locating particular polygons can involve linear search.
\end{itemize}

\label{cha::lit::graphs::spm}

\subsection{Visibility Graphs}
\label{cha::lit::graphs::vis}
A visibility graph~\citep{lozanoperez79} is a model of an input map based on
line-of-sight.  In the canonical case each vertex in a planar environment
becomes a node in a graph. Edges are then added between any pair of nodes that
are visible from one another.  Often employed in robot
motion planning and computer games, visibility graphs are popular due to their 
simplicity and ability to provide strong guarantees including completeness and 
(depending on the search strategy at hand) Euclidean optimality. Disadvantages 
include:
\begin{itemize}
\item Visibility graphs can be very large; in the worst case every
vertex is visibile from every other vertex and a quadratic number
of edges is required. Tangent Graphs~\citep{liu92} and Silhouette Zones~\citep{young01b}
are two variant approaches that address this shortcoming in many practical
cases but their memory requirements remain worst-case quadratic.
\item Visibility graphs are static models and must be recomputed or 
repaired if the environment changes.
\end{itemize}
