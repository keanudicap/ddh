\section{Improved Heuristics}
\label{cha::lit::heuristics}
Heuristic functions are employed in search to evaluate states in terms
of merit. In the case of local search, heuristics are used to choose 
a successor state from a large set of possible successors. In the case
of informed search heuristics provide estimates on the remaining distance 
to the goal. We discuss a range of representative works for computing such 
lower-bounds. This is in keeping with the scope of this thesis which is
concerned with optimality-preserving pathfinding techniques.

Algorithms of this type usually pre-compute and store distances between key pairs of locations
in the environment. Though fast and optimal, such methods can incur signficant
memory overheads which is often undesirable. Typical examples: Landmarks~\cite{goldberg05} and
True Distance Heuristics~\cite{sturtevant09}.
