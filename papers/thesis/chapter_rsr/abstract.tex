\chapter{Rectangular Symmetry Reduction}
\label{cha:rsr}
In this chapter we present Rectangular Symmetry Reduction (RSR): a graph pruning
algorithm for undirected uniform-cost grid maps which is fast, memory efficient,
optimality preserving and which can, in some cases, eliminate entirely the need
to search.  The central idea that we will explore involves the identification
and elimination of \emph{path symmetries} from the search space. 
Symmetry appears in many domains; for example in planning~\cite{fox99}, constraint 
programming \cite{walsh07} and combinatorial optimisation~\cite{fukunaga08}. 
Unless it is handled properly, symmetry almost always 
increases the size of the search space and forces search algorithms to waste time
considering variations of already known partial solutions.
\par
To deal with path symmetries RSR decomposes an arbitrary uniform-cost grid map
into a set of empty rectangles and removes from each such
rectangle all interior nodes and possibly some from along the perimeter.  A
series of macro edges are then added between selected pairs of remaining nodes
in order to facilitate provably optimal traversal through each rectangle.  
RSR can speed up A* search by up to 38 times on a range of uniform cost maps taken 
from the literature.  When compared to the state of the art, RSR shows signficant 
improvement; often dominating convincingly across a range of benchmarks.
\par
We first develop RSR in the context of 4-connected grid maps; a common
setting in video games and one which appears often in the AI literature.
We then turn our attention to 8-connected grid maps where the increase in
branching factor makes effective symmetry elimination more challenging. 
For this setting we develop a stronger symmetry breaking technique which can significantly
reduce the number of nodes that need to be explored during search. We also study a novel 
online pruning strategy which speeds up node expansion by selectively evaluating either 
all neighbours associated with a particular node or only a small subset.  
We prove that in each case both optimality and completeness are preserved. We also
show that RSR has only linear space requirements and find that it is orthogonal
to existing techniques for speeding up pathfinding search.
