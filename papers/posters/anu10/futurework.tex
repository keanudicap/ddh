We are investigating a number of extensions:
\begin{itemize}
\item{Stronger symmetry breaking techniques to \textbf{prune more tiles}.}
\item{An analogous algorithm for \textbf{8-connected grid maps}.
%Such maps also exhibit a high degree of path symmetry but the problem is more
%difficult due to higher branching factor.
}
\item{\textbf{Hybrid algorithms} that combine our speedup technique with existing methods
to achieve further performance increases.}
\end{itemize}
