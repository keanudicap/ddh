\section{Rectangular Symmetry Reduction}
\label{sec:rsr}

We define path symmetry in undirected uniform-cost grids as:
\begin{definition}
\label{def:symmetry}
Two paths $\pi_{1}$ and $\pi_{2}$ are symmetric if they share the same start and
goal node and one can be derived from the other by interchanging the order of the
moves.
\end{definition}

To identify and eliminate path symmetries from the grid we will employ the high 
level strategy in Algorithm \ref{alg:rsr}.

\input alg_rsr_short

Our approach has similarities with 4ERR~\cite{harabor10}, a symmetry breaking algorithm 
limited to 4-connected grid maps.
The main differences are: (i) we generalise 4ERR to 8-connected grid maps 
(ii) we give a stronger offline pruning operator to eliminate more nodes from
the grid (iii) we give a new online pruning operator that reduces a node's branching
factor and further speeds up search.
