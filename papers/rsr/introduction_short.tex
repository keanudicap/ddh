\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}
Pathfinding on undirected uniform-cost grid maps commonly appears in 
areas such as robotics \cite{lee09},
artificial intelligence \cite{wang09} and video games \cite{davis00,sturtevant10}.  
To solve problems quickly practitioners usually apply
hierarchical decomposition techniques such as HPA* \cite{botea04,sturtevant10} or 
develop more accurate heuristics to guide search~\cite{bjornsson06,sturtevant09,goldenberg10}.  
Each of these has disadvantages: either the returned solutions are
not guaranteed optimal or a substantial memory overhead is incurred.
\par
In this paper we present Rectangular Symmetry Reduction (RSR): a graph pruning
algorithm for undirected uniform-cost grid maps which is fast, memory efficient,
optimality preserving and which can, in some cases, eliminate entirely the need
to search.  
The central idea that we will explore involves identifying and eliminating 
path symmetries from the search space.
Along the way we generalise a similar pruning method proposed in \cite{harabor10},
which is limited to 4-connected uniform-cost grid maps.
\par
When compared to related methods from the literature we
find RSR has complementary strengths. We identify classes of instances
where RSR is clearly the better choice and show that it can often dominate convincingly
across a variety of synthetic and realistic benchmarks.
