\section{Conclusion}
We introduce Rectangular Symmetry Reduction (RSR), a new symmetry-breaking algorithm
applicable to pathfinding on undirected uniform-cost grid maps. RSR is fast,
memory efficient, optimality preserving and can, in some cases, eliminate
entirely the need to search.  After symmetry elimination A* can
search some grids over 30 times faster.
\par
Compared to the 4ERR~\cite{harabor10} pruning algorithm, on which it is based,
RSR's performance dominates convincingly.
We also show that RSR is complementary to and often faster than Swamps-based
pruning~\cite{pochter10}.
We find that Swamps are more useful on maps with small open areas
while RSR becomes more effective as larger open areas are available on a map. 
When compared to the enhanced Portal Heuristic~\cite{goldenberg10}, we find that 
RSR has similar or improved performance but requires up to 7 times less memory.
As with Swamps, this method can also be combined with RSR.
\par
An interesting direction for future work is applying RSR in settings involving 
dynamic environments: for example real-time strategy games where existing obstacles 
may be destroyed or new ones introduced.
Another interesting topic is combining RSR with Swamps or the Portal Heuristic.
