This document gives some ideas for improving Jump Point Search (JPS).  Our
first idea improves the neighbour pruning rules of JPS and allows us to ignore
during search nodes that JPS was previously forced to expand.  Our second idea
involves manipulating ``blocks'' of grid nodes rather than individual nodes.
It is our intuition that such techniques will improve the performance of JPS
for two reasons: i) it will reduce the number of operations (a group of nodes
will be processed in one go); ii) it will reduce the number of cache misses
(by manipulation pieces of data that are adjacent in memory).  Our third idea
involves offline pre-processing of the input map in order to identify jump
points apriori and thus significanty speed up search -- albeit at the cost
of additional memory.
