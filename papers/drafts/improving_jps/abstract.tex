We give online and offline optimisation techniques to improve the performance
of Jump Point Search (JPS): a recent and very effective symmetry-breaking
algorithm that speeds up pathfinding in computer games.  First, we give a new
and more efficient procedure for online symmetry breaking by manipulating
``blocks'' of nodes at a single time rather than individual nodes.  Second, we
give a new offline pre-processing technique that can identify jump points
apriori in order to further speed up pathfinding search.  Third, we enhance
the pruning rules of JPS, allowing it to ignore many nodes that must otherwise
be expanded.  On three benchmark domains taken from real computer games we show
that our  enhancements can improve JPS performance by anywhere from several
factors  to over one order of magnitude. We also compare our approaches with
SUB: a very recent state-of-the-art offline pathfinding algorithm. We show that
our improvements are competitive with this approach and often faster.
