Essentially, the reason why the existing algorithms are not complete 
is that the search is based on the grid intersections.  
However, because the final any-angle path 
may never cross these intersections, 
the $A^*$ $f$ value associated with the intersection
is not relevant.  
In this article, we propose to run the search not on the grid 
but instead on the edges of the graph.  
The semantics of the nodes of the graph, 
an edge and the corner of an obstacle, 
is that the path currently under consideration 
goes from the corner and crosses the edge.  
Because the final path will indeed cross the edge, 
the $f$ value of the node is relevant.
