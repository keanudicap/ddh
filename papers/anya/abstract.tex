Any-angle pathfinding is a common problem from robotics and computer games: it
requires finding a Euclidean shortest path between pairs of vertices in a grid
map.  Prior research has focused on approximate online solutions.  A number of
exact methods exist but they all require supra-linear space and preprocessing
time.
In this paper we describe Anya: a new optimal any-angle pathfinding algorithm 
which searches over sets of states represented as intervals. Each interval is
identified online. From each we select a representative point to derive a 
corresponding $f$-value for the set.
Anya always returns an optimal path. Moreover it does so entirely 
online, without any preprocessing or memory overheads. This result answers
an open question from the areas of Artificial Intelligence and Game Development: 
is there an any-angle pathfinding algorithm which is online, optimal and requires 
only linear space? The answer is yes.
