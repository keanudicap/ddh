\section{Preliminaries}
A \emph{grid} $G$ is a $W \times H$ matrix of tiles in which each tile is either
\emph{traversable} or \emph{non-traversable}\footnote{Such tiles are sometimes
called obstacles.}.
%It is common
%in such settings for each tile to represent a unique location in the grid and to
%assume there is an implicit vertex located at its centre~\cite{yap02}.  In this
%paper we follow~\cite{nash07} and adopt a slightly different model: 
Locations in the grid can be defined as a discrete set of points $p = (x, y)$
($x \in \{0,\dots,W\}$ and $y \in \{0,\dots,H\}$)
% refers to an explicit vertex 
and edges can be interpreted as continuous point intervals connecting two discrete points.
Each edge can be common to at most two adjacent tiles. Each discrete point can be common
to at most four adjacent tiles.
\\
Occasionally we will find it useful to distinguish between different kinds of points.
An \emph{intersection} is simply a discrete point that is common to four adjacent tiles.
A \emph{corner} is an intersection where three of the adjacent tiles are traversable
and one is not.
We will say that two points are \emph{visibile} from one another if there exists a 
straight-line path connecting them which does not pass through the interior of any
 non-traversable tiles.

%A \emph{corner} is an intersection 
%such that only one of its four squares is non-traversable.  
%Intersection $i'$ is \emph{visible} from intersection $i$ 
%iff the segment $(i,i')$ crosses only traversable tiles 
%or borders non-traversable tiles and traversable tiles.  
%Without loss of generality, 
%we assume that if the segment $(i,i')$ crosses a corner 
%(besides $i$ and $i'$), 
%then intersection $i'$ is not visible from intersection $i$.  

An \emph{any-angle path} $\pi$ is a sequence of discrete points 
$\langle p_1,\dots,p_k \rangle$ where each $p_{i}$ is visible from both $p_{i-1}$
and $p_{i+1}$.
The \emph{length} of path $\pi$ 
is the cumulative straight-line distance between every successive
pair of discrete points along the path, 
i.e., $d(p_1,p_2) + d(p_2,p_3) + \dots + d(p_{k-1},p_k)$, 
where $d((x,y), (x',y'))= \sqrt{(x-x')^2 + (y-y')^2}$ 
is a uniform Euclidean distance metric.
We will say $p_i \in \pi$ is a \emph{turning point} if the segments
$(p_{i-1}, p_i)$ and $(p_i, p_{i+1})$ form an angle.
\\
\begin{lemm}
\label{lemma::corner}
  Given two discrete points $p$ and $p'$, 
  any turning point in the optimal any-angle path between $p$ and $p'$ 
  is also a corner point.
\end{lemm}

\begin{proof}
{
  Assume an optimal any-angle path $\pi = (p_1,\dots,p_k)$ 
  that includes a turning point $p_l$ ($l \not\in \{0,k\}$) 
  which is not a corner.  
  %We will prove that $\pi$ is suboptimal 
  %which, by contradiction, will prove the lemma.  
  If $p_{l+1}$ is visible from $p_{l-1}$, 
  then  $\pi \setminus p_l$ is a path 
  which is strictly shorter than $\pi$.  
  Hence $\pi$ is suboptimal.  
  If $p_{l+1}$ is not visible from $p_{l-1}$, 
  then let $p'_{l}$ be a point from the segment $(p_l,p_{l+1})$ 
  that (i) is visible from $p_{l-1}$ 
  and (ii) is different from $p_l$.  
  Because $p_l$ is not a corner, 
  then such a $p'_l$ exists.  
  Moreover, the subpath $\langle p_{l-1}, p'_{l}, p_{l+1} \rangle$ is 
  strictly shorter than $\langle p_{l-1}, p_{l}, p_{l+1}\rangle$. 
  Hence $\pi$ is suboptimal.
  This case is is illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig::corner}  
  where the point $p'_l$ is chosen as close as possible from the corner $c$.
