To compile HOG, you will need headers (and some libraries) from the following
(Ubuntu) packages:

libgl1-mesa-dev libglu1-mesa-dev
libglut3-dev
libxi6 libxi-dev
libxmu6 libxmu-dev

Package names for other distributions (including Cygwin) should be
similar. Search in your package manager!  Also assumed is that an OpenGL
distribution is installed on the host machine. This is usually the case
with most modern distributions where at least a free MESA implementation is
available -- if not a more optimised proprietary version.
